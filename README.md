# Jumpy â€” Side-scrolling runner / platformer in C++ / ncurses
CS 300 Fall 2020 class  
In-class Game Jam 2020: Theme "cursed"

We chose C++ and `ncurses` because we were using them in the
course, and they were a good match to our design. Most of us
are pretty familiar with C++.

Inspired by the Google built-in Chrome browser game
"Dinosaur Runner".
